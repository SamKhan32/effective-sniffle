THis project is just a simple console level vending machine with three products - Pepsi, Lays, and Peanut M&Ms. I was hungry while making it, but it was rather helpful for understadning the
static keyword. Also learned was class interactions and working more with objects. I am happy with how professional the object to main operations were, although I recognize it could have been better.
